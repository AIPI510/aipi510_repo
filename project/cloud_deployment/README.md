# Deployment
This directory contains example approaches for deploying Python web apps using machine learning models on the cloud.  While the demo apps included here are simplistic, the deployment approaches demonstrated can be used for more substantial apps.  These examples demonstrate deployment of apps in Docker containers on the Google Cloud Platform via Google App Engine.  They will need to be adjusted to deploy apps on other cloud platforms. 

This directory contains the following:  
- **flask_deploy_example**  
    - directory containing the app code and deployment files for deploying an app using  Flask in a Docker container on GCP.  See README in directory for instructions  
- **streamlit_deploy_example**  
    - directory containing the app code and deployment files for deploying an app with a Streamlit user interface in a Docker container on GCP.  See README in directory for instructions
