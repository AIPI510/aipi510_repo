# Setting up your infrastructure 
Because we will need to use GPU acceleration for training models in this course, we will primarily be working on a cloud platform which allows us access to virtual machines (VMs) with GPU hardware.  Which cloud platform you choose to use is up to you.  This directory includes quickstart guides to setting up and working on the three major cloud platforms plus Colab Pro.  Choose which platform(s) you prefer to work on, and follow the below instructions to set up for work:  
- [Google Colab Pro](https://github.com/AIPI540/AIPI540-Deep-Learning-Applications/blob/main/0_infra_setup/ColabPro_quickstart.md)  
- [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://github.com/AIPI540/AIPI540-Deep-Learning-Applications/blob/main/0_infra_setup/GCP_quickstart.md)  
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://github.com/AIPI540/AIPI540-Deep-Learning-Applications/blob/main/0_infra_setup/AWS_quickstart.md)  
- [Microsoft Azure](https://github.com/AIPI540/AIPI540-Deep-Learning-Applications/blob/main/0_infra_setup/Azure_quickstart.md)

Some notebooks in this repo can be run locally on your computers, while others require GPU acceleration - they will be marked at top whether they should be run on CPU or GPU.  

After you git clone the repo to your computer, you will also need to install dependencies into a virtual environment to run the notebooks.  Follow the [setting up environment guide](https://github.com/AIPI540/AIPI540-Deep-Learning-Applications/blob/main/0_infra_setup/setting_up_environment.md) to do this.
