    "## Background\n",
    "You have recently been engaged on a consulting assignment by the NY State Department of Education to identify ways to improve the math performance of middle school students across the state.  The DoE believes that NY middle school students are not performing at a competitive level to other states in the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DoE has limited resources and would like to make data-driven decisions on how to deploy those resources to have maximum effect on the overall math performance of the state's middle school children.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Identify underperforming schools**   \n",
    "One of the main factors under control of the DoE is where to allocate their annual budget, e.g. how to distribute it amongst the counties and schools in the state.  Our hypothesis is that by identifying the most grossly underperforming areas of the state and allocating more of the budget to those areas, we can maximize the impact of our dollars available to spend.  Our analysis today will focus on identifying the worst performing schools and counties in mathematics, in order to help the DoE make budget allocation decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our analysis, we have decided to define an \"underperforming school\" as one in which average math assessment scores for grade 8 students have been in the bottom 10% of scores across the state for each of the past three years.  Identifying underperforming schools can help us focus our state's investment and efforts towards improving math outcomes for students in those schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being the brilliant data science consultant that you are, you know the next step is to look for data.  We know that in order to perform any useful analysis, we need data on average math assessment scores for grade 8 students broken down by school."

    "## Data\n",
    "The NY State DoE maintains a database of aggregated assessment scores for grades 3-8 for each public middle school in the state dating back to 2013-14, broken down into various demographic groups.  We can use this data to analyze the last three years of historical data and identify underperforming schools in mathematics.  "
